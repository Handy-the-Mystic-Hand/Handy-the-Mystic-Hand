## Reasons for Choosing this Specific Problem and Dataset

We found it to be a revolutionary change if we could control our systems with no other devices than our hands. As Computer Science students ourselves we sit in a fixed position in front of our laptops/pc for the majority of the time of the day, which is detrimental for us. We would like to create this new way of interacting with the screen such that we have the freedom to move around more while doing our work. We also hope users can customize our application to fit their needs. The databases we have selected are incredibly rich, with many hand poses already labeled, and there is a vast amount of images serving as data. This allows us to make our design and data processing more convenient. We will be using both OpenCV, Jupyter Notebook, and PyAutoGUI as our main tools for development. We will use Github to do our works separately and merge them at the end. We will communicate through our Discord Server.
